This is where I'll put my bio information. 

My name is Theresa and I am currently a student in the Year Up Program at the Seattle Central Community College campus. I was a student at the University of Washington's Seattle campus for 3 years for Industrial engineering prgram before I switched to a software developement track through Year Up.

I enjoy working with others and am quite a people person. I have maintained leadership roles like class president in my high school at John F. Kennedy Catholic High School as well as vice president in the industrial engineering student council at UW. Math is my strongest suit as I was on a math team that competed in compitions through Washington state.
