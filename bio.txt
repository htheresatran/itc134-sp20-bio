This is where I'll put my bio information. 

My name is Theresa and I am currently a student in the Year Up Program at the Seattle Central Community College campus. I was a student at the University of Washington's Seattle campus for 3 years for Industrial engineering prgram before I switched to a software developement track through Year Up.

I enjoy working with others and am quite a people person. I have maintained leadership roles like class president in my high school at John F. Kennedy Catholic High School as well as vice president in the industrial engineering student council at UW. Math is my strongest suit as I was on a math team that competed in compitions through Washington state which pushed me to explore the STEM field. 

I have worked as an ice cream scooper at many Molly Moon's location as well as Full Tilt (two Seattle based ice cream shops). I enjoy talking to new people and working the front of line in the food industry has been a strength of mine. I have been a server as well as a host at a few restaurants and I believe how one interacts with people can be a huge asset. 

Year Up is a program I hope to finish and jump start my career in to the world as someone knowledgable who can help and work with others. I enjoy the concept of teams as well as being coooperative with others. The world is bright with many people to meet!
